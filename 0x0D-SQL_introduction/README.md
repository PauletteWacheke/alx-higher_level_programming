Overview of SQL and MySQL.

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language for storing, manipulating, and retrieving data in databases1. It’s used in various database systems like MySQL, SQL Server, MS Access, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, Postgres, and others1. SQL commands can be divided into several types, including:

> Data Definition Language (DDL): Used to define database schema. Commands include CREATE, ALTER, DROP, etc.
> Data Manipulation Language (DML): Used to manipulate data in the database. Commands include SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.
> Data Control Language (DCL): Used to control access to data within the database. Commands include GRANT, REVOKE, etc2.


MySQL is a widely used relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses SQL3. It’s free, open-source, and ideal for both small and large applications3. MySQL provides various features such as stored procedures, triggers, views, and indexes4. It also allows you to interact with the database using various programming languages such as PHP, Java, Python, Node.js, and Perl4.
